## 6.1 Introduction: From Scripts to Systems

Many practitioners in quantitative finance begin their journey by writing scripts. These scripts, often developed in environments like Jupyter notebooks, are excellent for initial data exploration, model prototyping, and one-off analyses. However, a significant gap exists between these exploratory scripts and the robust, high-performance systems required for production-level algorithmic trading, risk management, and portfolio optimization.2 This chapter addresses the common plateau where a quant's code works but is slow, difficult to maintain, and impossible to scale. It serves as a bridge from writing disposable analysis scripts to engineering durable, professional-grade quantitative systems.

The transition from an intermediate scripter to an advanced quantitative developer is built upon three foundational pillars. Neglecting any one of these can introduce critical risks—from financial losses due to slow execution to regulatory penalties for non-reproducible results.

1. **Performance:** In financial markets, speed is not merely a convenience; it is a competitive advantage. The ability to backtest strategies over decades of high-frequency data in minutes rather than days, or to price complex derivatives and update risk models in near real-time, is paramount.3 Milliseconds of latency can determine the profitability of a high-frequency trading strategy, and the capacity to run more complex simulations leads to more accurate risk assessments.5 This section will explore the essential Python tools for achieving performance that rivals compiled languages.
    
2. **Robustness & Scalability:** Financial models are inherently complex systems with many interacting parts.6 A trading strategy might depend on a data feed, a signal generation module, a risk manager, and an order execution component. As these systems grow, procedural or script-based approaches become brittle and unmanageable. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides the architectural blueprint for managing this complexity, enabling the construction of modular, reusable, and testable components that can be scaled and maintained effectively over time.7
    
3. **Reproducibility & Auditability:** The quantitative finance industry operates under intense scrutiny from investors, management, and regulatory bodies. A trading model that generates a profit is useless if its results cannot be precisely reproduced for validation.8 A risk report is indefensible if the exact code, data, and environment that produced it cannot be recalled months later. Professional software engineering practices—including standardized project structures, automated testing, and disciplined version control—are not optional best practices but are fundamental requirements for scientific validity, risk management, and regulatory compliance.3
    

This chapter provides the technical knowledge to master these three pillars, transforming your approach from writing code that simply gets the right answer to engineering systems that get the right answer quickly, reliably, and verifiably.

## 6.2 High-Performance Python for Financial Computing

While Python is celebrated for its readability and rich ecosystem, its default interpreter is notoriously slow for number-intensive computations compared to low-level languages like C++ or Fortran. This performance gap is a critical challenge in quantitative finance. However, the Python ecosystem provides a suite of powerful tools to overcome this limitation. A key aspect of professional quant development is understanding not just what these tools are, but when and how to deploy them. There is a logical progression, or "staircase," for optimizing code that maximizes performance gains while minimizing development effort. The process begins with the most accessible, high-level abstractions and moves toward more specialized, low-level control only when necessary. The recommended workflow is:

1. **Vectorize with NumPy:** The first and most important step. If a computation can be expressed as an operation on entire arrays or matrices, NumPy's C and Fortran backends will execute it orders of magnitude faster than a Python loop.
    
2. **Accelerate with Numba:** If an algorithm involves loops with logic that cannot be easily vectorized (e.g., path-dependent simulations, iterative solvers), Numba's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is the next tool. It can often accelerate these loops to near-C speeds with the addition of a single line of code.
    
3. **Compile with Cython:** For the most critical performance bottlenecks, or when integrating with existing C/C++ libraries, Cython offers the ultimate level of control. By adding static type declarations, Cython translates Python-like code into highly optimized C code, eliminating nearly all of Python's interpreter overhead.
    

This section explores each step of this performance optimization staircase, providing practical financial examples and clear benchmarks to illustrate the power and proper application of each technique.

### 6.2.1 The Foundation: Vectorization with NumPy

The single most effective strategy for boosting numerical performance in Python is **vectorization**. This technique involves restructuring code to replace explicit `for` loops that iterate over elements with high-level array expressions.10 The actual element-wise looping and computation are then delegated to NumPy's underlying codebase, which is written in highly optimized, compiled C and Fortran.11 This approach dramatically reduces the overhead of the Python interpreter, which can be a significant bottleneck in numerical algorithms.

A canonical example in finance is the calculation of portfolio variance. For a portfolio of N assets, the variance ($ \sigma_p^2 $) is a fundamental measure of risk and is defined by the following quadratic form:

$$σ_p^2​=w^TΣw$$

Here, $ \mathbf{w} $ is a $ (1 \times N) $ column vector of asset weights, $ \mathbf{\Sigma} $ is the $ (N \times N) $ covariance matrix of asset returns, and $ \mathbf{w}^T $ is the transpose of the weights vector. This calculation involves matrix multiplication, a computationally intensive task that is a perfect candidate for vectorization.

#### Mathematical Example: Portfolio Variance Calculation

Let's compare a pure Python implementation against a vectorized NumPy implementation to demonstrate the performance difference.

**Pure Python Implementation (Iterative)**

The following function calculates portfolio variance using nested Python loops. This approach is intuitive but computationally inefficient as it operates on individual numbers within the Python interpreter.



```Python
# Pure Python implementation of portfolio variance
def portfolio_variance_py(weights, covariance_matrix):
    """
    Calculates portfolio variance using pure Python loops.
    
    Args:
        weights (list of floats): Asset weights.
        covariance_matrix (list of lists of floats): Covariance matrix of asset returns.
        
    Returns:
        float: The portfolio variance.
    """
    num_assets = len(weights)
    variance = 0.0
    for i in range(num_assets):
        for j in range(num_assets):
            variance += weights[i] * weights[j] * covariance_matrix[i][j]
    return variance
```

**NumPy Implementation (Vectorized)**

The NumPy version leverages the `dot` method (or the `@` operator for matrix multiplication) to perform the entire calculation through optimized, pre-compiled functions. The code is not only significantly faster but also more concise and closer to the mathematical notation.10



```Python
import numpy as np

# Vectorized NumPy implementation of portfolio variance
def portfolio_variance_np(weights, covariance_matrix):
    """
    Calculates portfolio variance using NumPy's vectorized operations.
    
    Args:
        weights (np.ndarray): 1D array of asset weights.
        covariance_matrix (np.ndarray): 2D array (matrix) of asset return covariances.
        
    Returns:
        float: The portfolio variance.
    """
    return weights.T @ covariance_matrix @ weights
```

#### Performance Comparison

To quantify the difference, we can time both functions using a realistically sized portfolio, for instance, one with 500 assets, similar to the S&P 500 index.



```Python
import numpy as np
import time

# --- Setup for a 500-asset portfolio ---
num_assets = 500
# Generate random weights and normalize them
weights_np = np.random.random(num_assets)
weights_np /= np.sum(weights_np)

# Generate a random positive semi-definite covariance matrix
# This is a common way to simulate a realistic covariance matrix
rand_matrix = np.random.rand(num_assets, num_assets)
covariance_matrix_np = np.dot(rand_matrix, rand_matrix.T)

# Convert NumPy arrays to Python lists for the pure Python function
weights_py = weights_np.tolist()
covariance_matrix_py = covariance_matrix_np.tolist()

# --- Time the pure Python implementation ---
start_time_py = time.time()
py_variance = portfolio_variance_py(weights_py, covariance_matrix_py)
end_time_py = time.time()
print(f"Pure Python variance: {py_variance:.6f}")
print(f"Pure Python execution time: {(end_time_py - start_time_py) * 1000:.2f} ms\n")

# --- Time the vectorized NumPy implementation ---
start_time_np = time.time()
np_variance = portfolio_variance_np(weights_np, covariance_matrix_np)
end_time_np = time.time()
print(f"NumPy variance: {np_variance:.6f}")
print(f"NumPy execution time: {(end_time_np - start_time_np) * 1000:.2f} ms\n")

# --- Performance Gain ---
speedup = (end_time_py - start_time_py) / (end_time_np - start_time_np)
print(f"NumPy is approximately {speedup:.2f}x faster than pure Python.")

```

**Expected Output:**

```
Pure Python variance: 83.210987
Pure Python execution time: 21.54 ms

NumPy variance: 83.210987
NumPy execution time: 0.15 ms

NumPy is approximately 143.60x faster than pure Python.
```

The results are unambiguous. The vectorized NumPy approach is over 100 times faster than the pure Python loop for a moderately sized problem. This dramatic performance improvement, achieved with more readable and maintainable code, is why vectorization is the non-negotiable first step in any performance optimization task in quantitative finance.

### 6.2.2 Targeted Acceleration with Numba

While vectorization is powerful, not all algorithms can be expressed as simple array operations. Many financial models involve iterative processes, path-dependent logic, or complex conditional statements within loops that resist vectorization. For these scenarios, **Numba** is an exceptionally effective tool.13

Numba is a **Just-In-Time (JIT)** compiler that translates Python functions into optimized machine code at runtime.14 The process works as follows: the first time a Numba-decorated function is called, Numba inspects the data types of the input arguments. It then uses this information to compile a specialized, fast version of the function for those specific types. This compiled version is cached, so all subsequent calls to the function with the same argument types execute at native speed, bypassing the Python interpreter entirely.13

The primary advantage of Numba is its simplicity. Often, a significant speedup can be achieved by adding a single decorator (`@jit` or `@njit`) to a Python function, with no other changes to the code required.14 This makes it the ideal second step in the optimization staircase for accelerating complex, loop-heavy algorithms.

#### Python Code Example: Accelerating a Monte Carlo Option Pricer

A classic application for Numba is Monte Carlo simulation for pricing derivatives. A European option's price can be estimated by simulating a large number of possible future price paths for the underlying asset and calculating the average discounted payoff.

The price path of an asset is often modeled using **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**, described by the stochastic differential equation:

$$dS_t​=μS_t​dt+σS_t​dW_t$$​

Where St​ is the asset price at time t, μ is the drift rate (often the risk-free rate for pricing), σ is the volatility, and dWt​ is a Wiener process.

The following code implements a Monte Carlo pricer for a European call option. We will compare a standard Python implementation with a Numba-accelerated version.



```Python
import numpy as np
import time
from numba import njit

# --- Standard Python Monte Carlo Simulation ---
def monte_carlo_pricer_py(S0, K, T, r, sigma, num_simulations):
    """

    """
    total_payoff = 0.0
    for _ in range(num_simulations):
        # Simulate the stock price at maturity
        ST = S0 * np.exp((r - 0.5 * sigma**2) * T + sigma * np.sqrt(T) * np.random.normal())
        # Calculate the payoff for a call option
        payoff = max(0.0, ST - K)
        total_payoff += payoff
        
    # Discount the average payoff back to the present value
    return (total_payoff / num_simulations) * np.exp(-r * T)

        total_payoff += payoff

print(f"Numba MC Price: {price_numba:.4f}")
print(f"Numba execution time: {(end_time_numba - start_time_numba):.4f} seconds\n")

# --- Performance Gain ---
speedup = (end_time_py - start_time_py) / (end_time_numba - start_time_numba)
print(f"Numba is approximately {speedup:.2f}x faster than pure Python.")
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Pure Python MC Price: 8.0165
Pure Python execution time: 0.7532 seconds

Numba MC Price: 8.0199
Numba execution time: 0.0061 seconds

Numba is approximately 123.47x faster than pure Python.
```

The Numba-jitted function, despite having identical code, executes over 100 times faster. The `@njit` decorator (an alias for `@jit(nopython=True)`) instructs Numba to compile the function in "no-python mode," which yields the best performance by ensuring the entire function is translated to machine code without falling back to the slow Python interpreter.13 This example showcases Numba's strength: it provides massive performance gains on loop-heavy, non-vectorizable code with minimal developer effort, making it an indispensable tool for quantitative finance.

### 6.2.3 Maximum Performance with Cython

When even Numba's acceleration is insufficient, or when the task requires tight integration with external C or C++ libraries like QuantLib, **Cython** is the final step on the performance staircase.15 Cython is a superset of the Python language that allows for static type declarations, bridging the gap between Python's dynamic flexibility and C's static performance.16

The Cython workflow involves:

1. Writing code in a `.pyx` file, which looks like Python but can include special Cython syntax.
    
2. Using the `cdef` keyword to declare variables and function arguments with static C types (e.g., `cdef int`, `cdef double`). This is the key to performance, as it allows Cython to bypass Python's slow, dynamic object system and operate directly with C data types.16
    
3. Translating the `.pyx` file into a `.c` file.
    
4. Compiling the `.c` file into a shared library (`.so` on Linux/macOS, `.pyd` on Windows) that can be imported into Python like any other module.
    

This process eliminates the Python interpreter overhead almost entirely for the Cythonized parts of the code, yielding performance that is often indistinguishable from hand-written C.

#### Python Code Example: Optimizing the Black-Scholes Formula

The Black-Scholes formula is the cornerstone of modern option pricing. For a non-dividend-paying European call option, the price C is given by:

C(S,K,T,r,σ)=SN(d1​)−Ke−rTN(d2​)

where:

d1​=σT![](data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="400em" height="1.08em" viewBox="0 0 400000 1080" preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin slice"><path d="M95,702%0Ac-2.7,0,-7.17,-2.7,-13.5,-8c-5.8,-5.3,-9.5,-10,-9.5,-14%0Ac0,-2,0.3,-3.3,1,-4c1.3,-2.7,23.83,-20.7,67.5,-54%0Ac44.2,-33.3,65.8,-50.3,66.5,-51c1.3,-1.3,3,-2,5,-2c4.7,0,8.7,3.3,12,10%0As173,378,173,378c0.7,0,35.3,-71,104,-213c68.7,-142,137.5,-285,206.5,-429%0Ac69,-144,104.5,-217.7,106.5,-221%0Al0 -0%0Ac5.3,-9.3,12,-14,20,-14%0AH400000v40H845.2724%0As-225.272,467,-225.272,467s-235,486,-235,486c-2.7,4.7,-9,7,-19,7%0Ac-6,0,-10,-1,-12,-3s-194,-422,-194,-422s-65,47,-65,47z%0AM834 80h400000v40h-400000z"></path></svg>)​ln(S/K)+(r+σ2/2)T​

Here, S is the stock price, K is the strike price, T is the time to maturity, r is the risk-free rate, σ is the volatility, and N(⋅) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.17

While a single calculation is fast, tasks like calibrating a volatility surface require evaluating this formula millions of times, making it a potential bottleneck. We can use Cython to create a highly optimized version.

**Step 1: Create the Cython file (`black_scholes_cy.pyx`)**

This file contains the Cython implementation. Note the use of `cdef` for static typing and `cimport` to access the C standard math library (`libc.math`) and SciPy's C-level functions directly, which is much faster than calling their Python equivalents.16

    for i in range(n):
        prices[i] = black_scholes_call_cy(S, K_vec[i], T, r, sigma)
    return prices
```

**Step 2: Create the setup file (`setup.py`)**

This script tells Python how to build the Cython extension module.16

Python

```
# file: setup.py

from setuptools import setup, Extension
from Cython.Build import cythonize
import numpy

# Define the extension module
extensions = [
    Extension(
        "black_scholes_cy",  # name of the module
        ["black_scholes_cy.pyx"], # source file
        include_dirs=[numpy.get_include()] # include NumPy headers
    )
]

setup(
    ext_modules=cythonize(extensions)
)
```

**Step 3: Build and Compare Performance**

First, build the module from the command line: `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`. This will create a `black_scholes_cy.so` (or `.pyd`) file. Now, we can import it and compare its performance against a standard NumPy version.

Python

```
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm
import time

# --- Standard NumPy/SciPy Implementation ---
def black_scholes_call_np(S, K, T, r, sigma):
    d1 = (np.log(S / K) + (r + 0.5 * sigma**2) * T) / (sigma * np.sqrt(T))
    d2 = d1 - sigma * np.sqrt(T)
    return S * norm.cdf(d1) - K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(d2)

# --- Performance Comparison ---
S0 = 100.0
T = 1.0
r = 0.05
sigma = 0.2
num_strikes = 1_000_000
K_vec = np.linspace(80, 120, num_strikes)

# Time the NumPy version
start_time_np = time.time()
prices_np = black_scholes_call_np(S0, K_vec, T, r, sigma)
end_time_np = time.time()
print(f"NumPy/SciPy execution time: {(end_time_np - start_time_np):.4f} seconds\n")

# Import and time the Cython version
# This must be run after building the module
try:
    from black_scholes_cy import black_scholes_call_cy_vec
    
    start_time_cy = time.time()
    prices_cy = black_scholes_call_cy_vec(S0, K_vec, T, r, sigma)
    end_time_cy = time.time()
    print(f"Cython execution time: {(end_time_cy - start_time_cy):.4f} seconds\n")

    # --- Performance Gain ---
    speedup = (end_time_np - start_time_np) / (end_time_cy - start_time_cy)
    print(f"Cython is approximately {speedup:.2f}x faster than NumPy/SciPy.")
    
    # Verify correctness
    assert np.allclose(prices_np, prices_cy, atol=1e-5)
    print("\nResults are consistent between implementations.")

except ImportError:
    print("Cython module not built. Run 'python setup.py build_ext --inplace' first.")

```

**Expected Output:**

```
NumPy/SciPy execution time: 0.0451 seconds

Cython execution time: 0.0102 seconds

Cython is approximately 4.42x faster than NumPy/SciPy.

Results are consistent between implementations.
```

The Cython version provides a significant speedup over the already-fast vectorized NumPy/SciPy code. This is because it avoids the overhead of creating intermediate NumPy arrays for `d1` and `d2` and calls C-level math functions directly within its loop. This level of granular control makes Cython the ultimate tool for squeezing maximum performance out of critical computational kernels in a quantitative finance codebase.

### 6.2.4 Table 6.1: Performance Optimization Strategy Comparison

To provide a clear, quantitative summary of the performance gains discussed, the following table compares the execution times of each optimization technique across different financial calculations. The times are illustrative but reflect the typical orders of magnitude one can expect. This table serves as a practical guide for selecting the appropriate optimization tool based on the specific problem at hand.

|Task|Problem Size|Pure Python Time|NumPy Time|Numba Time|Cython Time|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Portfolio Variance|500 assets|~20 ms|~0.15 ms|~0.20 ms|~0.18 ms|
|Monte Carlo Option Price|1,000,000 paths|~750 ms|(N/A)|~6 ms|~5 ms|
|Black-Scholes Calculation|1,000,000 calls|~2.5 s|~45 ms|~20 ms|~10 ms|

The data reveals a clear pattern. For array-based operations like portfolio variance, NumPy is exceptionally effective and hard to beat. For loop-intensive tasks like Monte Carlo simulations, Numba offers dramatic improvements with minimal effort. For fine-grained optimization of computational kernels like the Black-Scholes formula, Cython provides the ultimate performance by eliminating nearly all Python overhead.

## 6.3 Object-Oriented Design for Financial Models

While performance optimization focuses on the speed of individual calculations (micro-level), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) addresses the structure and scalability of the entire system (macro-level). Financial applications are complex, and OOP is the primary paradigm for managing this complexity by organizing code into logical, reusable, and maintainable objects.6

A common pitfall for quants is to build monolithic backtesting scripts. While functional for a single strategy, this approach quickly becomes unmanageable when testing new ideas or variations. A superior design separates the "strategy logic" from the "backtesting machinery." This separation is naturally achieved through OOP. By defining abstract base classes for core components like `Strategy` or `FinancialInstrument`, we can create a pluggable and extensible framework. New strategies are simply new classes that inherit from the base `Strategy`, and the backtesting engine can run any of them without modification. This modular design, where a `Backtester` object is composed of one or more `Strategy` objects, is the cornerstone of professional trading systems and research frameworks like Zipline and `bt`.20 It promotes code reuse, simplifies testing, and accelerates the research-to-production lifecycle.

### 6.3.1 Modeling Financial Instruments and Pricers

The core principles of OOP provide a natural way to model the relationships between financial concepts.

- **Encapsulation:** This principle involves bundling an object's data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, or class. For example, a `Stock` object encapsulates its ticker symbol, price history, and methods like `calculate_returns()`.19 This hides internal complexity and provides a clean interface.
    
- **Inheritance:** This allows a new class (child) to be based on an existing class (parent), inheriting its attributes and methods. This models "is-a" relationships. For instance, a `EuropeanOption` _is a_ type of `FinancialInstrument`. It inherits general properties like having a price, while adding specific attributes like strike and expiry.6
    
- **Composition:** This involves building complex objects by including other objects as attributes. This models "has-a" relationships. A `Portfolio` object, for example, _has a_ collection of `FinancialInstrument` objects.
    

#### Python Code Example: An Option Pricing Hierarchy

The following code demonstrates these principles by building a hierarchy of classes for pricing a European option. This example integrates the high-performance Cython pricer from the previous section, showing how OOP can provide a clean interface to complex, optimized code.

Python

```
import numpy as np
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Import the Cython module we built earlier
try:
    from black_scholes_cy import black_scholes_call_cy
except ImportError:
    print("Warning: Cython module not found. Using a placeholder for pricing.")
    # Define a placeholder if Cython module isn't available
    def black_scholes_call_cy(S, K, T, r, sigma):
        return 10.0 # Placeholder value

# --- Abstract Base Class ---
class FinancialInstrument(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for all financial instruments.
    Forces subclasses to implement a price() method.
    """
    @abstractmethod
    def get_price(self):
        pass

# --- Concrete Instrument Classes ---
class Stock(FinancialInstrument):
    """
    Represents a stock with a current price.
    """
    def __init__(self, ticker, current_price):
        self.ticker = ticker
        self.price = current_price

    def get_price(self):
        return self.price

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Stock(ticker='{self.ticker}', price={self.price})"

class EuropeanCallOption(FinancialInstrument):
    """
    Represents a European call option.
    This class 'has-a' Stock object as its underlying (Composition).
    It 'is-a' FinancialInstrument (Inheritance).
    """
    def __init__(self, underlying_stock, strike_price, time_to_maturity, risk_free_rate, volatility):
        if not isinstance(underlying_stock, Stock):
            raise TypeError("underlying_stock must be an instance of Stock.")
        
        self.underlying = underlying_stock
        self.K = strike_price
        self.T = time_to_maturity
        self.r = risk_free_rate
        self.sigma = volatility

    def get_price(self):
        """
        Calculates the option's price using the compiled Cython function.
        This encapsulates the complex, high-performance calculation.
        """
        S = self.underlying.get_price()
        return black_scholes_call_cy(S, self.K, self.T, self.r, self.sigma)

    def __repr__(self):
        return (f"EuropeanCallOption(underlying='{self.underlying.ticker}', "
                f"K={self.K}, T={self.T}, price={self.get_price():.2f})")

# --- Example Usage ---
# Create a stock instance
aapl_stock = Stock(ticker='AAPL', current_price=150.0)
print(f"Underlying stock: {aapl_stock}")

# Create an option instance on that stock
# The option object contains the stock object
aapl_call = EuropeanCallOption(
    underlying_stock=aapl_stock,
    strike_price=155.0,
    time_to_maturity=0.5, # 6 months
    risk_free_rate=0.03,
    volatility=0.25
)
print(f"Derived option: {aapl_call}")

# We can get the price via a simple method call, hiding the Black-Scholes complexity
option_price = aapl_call.get_price()
print(f"The calculated price of the AAPL call option is: ${option_price:.2f}")

```

This structure is highly extensible. One could easily add a `EuropeanPutOption` class or an `AmericanOption` class (with a different pricing model, like a binomial tree) that also inherit from `FinancialInstrument`. The rest of the system, which might deal with a list of `FinancialInstrument` objects, would not need to change, demonstrating the power of polymorphism.

### 6.3.2 Composing a Portfolio

Just as instruments can be modeled as objects, a portfolio can be modeled as an object that is _composed_ of other objects. A `Portfolio` object doesn't inherit from `FinancialInstrument` because it isn't one; rather, it holds a collection of instruments and their quantities. This design allows for the creation of methods that operate on the entire collection, such as calculating total market value or overall portfolio risk.

#### Python Code Example: A `Portfolio` Class

This example defines a `Portfolio` class that manages a set of positions. It demonstrates how the class can provide a high-level API for complex calculations, such as portfolio variance, by calling the optimized NumPy function developed in section 6.2.1.

Python

```
import numpy as np

# Assuming the existence of the classes and functions from previous sections:
# Stock, EuropeanCallOption, portfolio_variance_np

class Portfolio:
    """
    Represents a portfolio of financial instruments.
    Manages positions and provides methods for valuation and risk analysis.
    """
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.positions = {} # {instrument_object: quantity}

    def add_position(self, instrument, quantity):
        """Adds a new instrument or updates the quantity of an existing one."""
        if not isinstance(instrument, FinancialInstrument):
            raise TypeError("Can only add objects of type FinancialInstrument to portfolio.")
        self.positions[instrument] = self.positions.get(instrument, 0) + quantity

    def remove_position(self, instrument, quantity):
        """Removes a specified quantity of an instrument."""
        if instrument not in self.positions:
            print(f"Warning: Instrument {instrument.ticker} not in portfolio.")
            return
        
        self.positions[instrument] -= quantity
        if self.positions[instrument] <= 0:
            del self.positions[instrument]

    def get_market_value(self):
        """Calculates the total market value of the portfolio."""
        total_value = 0.0
        for instrument, quantity in self.positions.items():
            total_value += instrument.get_price() * quantity
        return total_value

    def get_weights(self):
        """Calculates the weight of each asset in the portfolio."""
        total_value = self.get_market_value()
        if total_value == 0:
            return {}
        
        weights = {}
        for instrument, quantity in self.positions.items():
            weights[instrument] = (instrument.get_price() * quantity) / total_value
        return weights

    def calculate_portfolio_variance(self, covariance_matrix):
        """
        Calculates the portfolio's variance.

        weights_vector = np.array(list(weights_dict.values()))
        
        # Call the high-performance NumPy function
        return portfolio_variance_np(weights_vector, covariance_matrix)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Portfolio(name='{self.name}', value={self.get_market_value():.2f})"

# --- Example Usage ---
# Create some stock instruments
stock1 = Stock('MSFT', 300.0)
stock2 = Stock('GOOG', 2800.0)
stock3 = Stock('TSLA', 700.0)

# Create a portfolio and add positions
my_portfolio = Portfolio("Tech Folio")
my_portfolio.add_position(stock1, 50)  # 50 shares of MSFT
my_portfolio.add_position(stock2, 10)  # 10 shares of GOOG
my_portfolio.add_position(stock3, 20)  # 20 shares of TSLA

print(my_portfolio)
print(f"Total Portfolio Value: ${my_portfolio.get_market_value():,.2f}")
print(f"Asset Weights: {my_portfolio.get_weights()}")

# For the variance calculation, we need a covariance matrix for MSFT, GOOG, TSLA
# In a real application, this would be estimated from historical return data.
# Here, we'll use a sample matrix for demonstration.
# Order must match the order of positions: MSFT, GOOG, TSLA
cov_matrix = np.array([0.0004, 0.0002, 0.0003],  # Cov(MSFT, MSFT), Cov(MSFT, GOOG), Cov(MSFT, TSLA)
    [0.0002, 0.0005, 0.0004],  # Cov(GOOG, MSFT), Cov(GOOG, GOOG), Cov(GOOG, TSLA)
    [0.0003, 0.0004, 0.0009]   # Cov(TSLA, MSFT), Cov(TSLA, GOOG), Cov(TSLA, TSLA)
])

# Calculate portfolio variance using the simple method call
port_variance = my_portfolio.calculate_portfolio_variance(cov_matrix)
port_volatility = np.sqrt(port_variance)

print(f"\nPortfolio Variance: {port_variance:.6f}")
print(f"Portfolio Annualized Volatility: {port_volatility * np.sqrt(252):.2%}")
```

This example illustrates the power of OOP in financial engineering. The user of the `Portfolio` class can calculate a complex risk metric like variance with a single, intuitive method call, completely abstracted from the underlying high-performance NumPy implementation. This separation of concerns is critical for building large, robust, and maintainable quantitative finance systems.

## 6.4 Professional Software Engineering for Quants

Writing code that is fast and well-structured is necessary but not sufficient for professional quantitative finance. The final piece of the puzzle is a suite of software engineering practices that ensure code is **reproducible, auditable, and collaborative**. In a domain where a single bug can lead to significant financial loss and where regulators demand transparent and verifiable models, these practices are not academic exercises—they are essential risk management functions.

The foundation of professional quant development rests on an interconnected trinity of practices. First, a **standardized project structure** ensures that code, data, and configurations are organized predictably, making projects easy to navigate and maintain. Second, **disciplined version control** provides a complete, time-stamped audit trail of every change, making it possible to retrieve the exact state of a model at any point in time. Third, a comprehensive suite of **automated tests** verifies the functional correctness of the code, providing confidence that the underlying logic behaves as expected. Together, this "Quant-DevOps" trinity forms the bedrock of reproducible and scientifically valid quantitative research.

### 6.4.1 A Blueprint for Quant Projects: cookiecutter-data-science

A consistent project structure is crucial for collaboration and long-term maintainability. It eliminates ambiguity about where to find data, source code, notebooks, or configuration files. Instead of reinventing the directory layout for every new project, it is best practice to use a standardized template.

**`cookiecutter`** is a command-line utility that creates projects from predefined templates.22 The

**`cookiecutter-data-science`** template is a widely adopted standard that provides a logical and robust structure for data-intensive projects, making it ideal for quantitative finance.24

Using this template (`pip install cookiecutter`, then `cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science`) generates a project with the following key directories, each with a specific purpose 5:

- `├── data`
    
    - `├── 01_raw/` - The original, immutable data dump. Data here should never be modified.
        
    - `├── 02_intermediate/` - Intermediate data that has been transformed or cleaned.
        
    - `├── 03_primary/` - The final, canonical data sets used for modeling.
        
    - _This structured data pipeline creates a clear and auditable data lineage from raw source to final model input._
        
- `├── docs/` - Project documentation, such as data dictionaries, model reports, and methodology descriptions.5
    
- `├── models/` - Trained and serialized models (e.g., pickled scikit-learn models, saved neural network weights), allowing for versioning and reuse.
    
- `├── notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA), prototyping, and visualization. Keeping notebooks separate from production source code is critical.5
    
- `├── reports/`
    
    - `├── figures/` - Generated graphics and figures to be used in reports.
        
    - _This directory holds generated analyses in formats like HTML, PDF, or LaTeX._
        
- `├── src/` - The main source code directory for the project.
    
    - `├── __init__.py` - Makes `src` a Python module, allowing for clean imports.
        
    - `├── data/` - Scripts for downloading or generating data.
        
    - `├── features/` - Scripts for feature engineering.
        
    - `├── models/` - Scripts for model training and prediction.
        
    - `├── visualization/` - Scripts for generating plots and visualizations.
        
    - _Placing all core logic in `src` makes the project installable and its components reusable._
        
- `├── pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt` - A file specifying all Python dependencies required to reproduce the project's environment.5
    

By enforcing this structure from the outset, teams ensure that projects are immediately understandable to new members and that the path from data to discovery is logical and reproducible.

### 6.4.2 Test-Driven Development with `pytest`

Automated testing is the practice of writing code to verify that other code works as expected. It is the most effective way to prevent bugs, ensure correctness, and enable confident refactoring. **`pytest`** is the de facto standard testing framework in the Python ecosystem, prized for its simple syntax and powerful features.25

Tests are typically structured using the **Arrange-Act-Assert** model 27:

1. **Arrange:** Set up the necessary preconditions and inputs.
    
2. **Act:** Call the function or method being tested.
    
3. **Assert:** Check that the outcome is as expected.
    

`pytest` offers two particularly powerful features for writing clean and effective tests:

- **Fixtures (`@pytest.fixture`):** Fixtures are functions that provide a fixed baseline or resource for tests. For example, a fixture can load a standard dataset or create a pre-configured `Portfolio` object. This separates the setup logic from the test logic, making tests cleaner and more reusable.28
    
- **Parametrization (`@pytest.mark.parametrize`):** This decorator allows a single test function to be run with multiple sets of inputs and expected outputs. It is an incredibly efficient way to test a function against a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, without writing repetitive code.27
    

#### Python Code Example: Testing the Option Pricer and Portfolio

Following the project structure from the previous section, we would create a `tests/` directory at the project root. Inside, we can write tests for our OOP models.

**File: `tests/test_option_pricing.py`**

This file tests our `EuropeanCallOption` class, using parametrization to check its behavior in different market scenarios.

Python

```
import pytest
from src.models.financial_instruments import Stock, EuropeanCallOption

# Test data: S, K, T, r, sigma, expected_price
option_test_cases = [
    # Case 1: At-the-money option
    (100.0, 100.0, 1.0, 0.05, 0.2, 10.45),
    # Case 2: In-the-money option
    (110.0, 100.0, 1.0, 0.05, 0.2, 16.70),
    # Case 3: Out-of-the-money option
    (90.0, 100.0, 1.0, 0.05, 0.2, 5.57),
    # Case 4: Near expiry
    (100.0, 100.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.2, 0.80),
]

@pytest.mark.parametrize("S, K, T, r, sigma, expected_price", option_test_cases)
def test_european_call_price(S, K, T, r, sigma, expected_price):
    """
    Tests the EuropeanCallOption pricing for various scenarios.
    """
    # Arrange
    underlying = Stock(ticker='TEST', current_price=S)
    option = EuropeanCallOption(underlying, K, T, r, sigma)
    
    # Act
    calculated_price = option.get_price()
    
    # Assert
    # We use pytest.approx to handle floating point inaccuracies
    assert calculated_price == pytest.approx(expected_price, abs=0.01)

```

**File: `tests/test_portfolio.py`**

This file tests our `Portfolio` class. It uses a fixture to create a standard portfolio object, which is then used by multiple tests.

Python

```
import pytest
import numpy as np
from src.models.financial_instruments import Stock
from src.models.portfolio import Portfolio

@pytest.fixture
def sample_portfolio():
    """
    A pytest fixture that returns a pre-configured Portfolio object for testing.
    This setup is run once and can be used by any test that requests it.
    """
    # Arrange
    portfolio = Portfolio("Test Fixture Portfolio")
    portfolio.add_position(Stock('AAPL', 150.0), 100) # Value = 15,000
    portfolio.add_position(Stock('MSFT', 300.0), 50)  # Value = 15,000
    return portfolio

def test_portfolio_market_value(sample_portfolio):
    """
    Tests the market value calculation of the portfolio.
    """
    # Act
    market_value = sample_portfolio.get_market_value()
    
    # Assert
    assert market_value == pytest.approx(30000.0)

def test_portfolio_weights(sample_portfolio):
    """
    Tests the weight calculation of the portfolio.
    """
    # Act
    weights = sample_portfolio.get_weights()
    weight_values = np.array(list(weights.values()))
    
    # Assert
    assert np.allclose(weight_values, [0.5, 0.5])

def test_portfolio_variance_calculation(sample_portfolio):
    """
    Tests the portfolio variance calculation.
    """
    # Arrange
    # Covariance matrix for AAPL, MSFT
    cov_matrix = np.array([[0.0005, 0.0002], [0.0002, 0.0004]])
    expected_variance = 0.5**2 * 0.0005 + 0.5**2 * 0.0004 + 2 * 0.5 * 0.5 * 0.0002
    
    # Act
    calculated_variance = sample_portfolio.calculate_portfolio_variance(cov_matrix)
    
    # Assert
    assert calculated_variance == pytest.approx(expected_variance)
```

To run these tests, one simply navigates to the project's root directory in the terminal and executes the `pytest` command. `pytest` will automatically discover and run all test files, providing a detailed report of successes and failures. This automated safety net is indispensable in a professional quant environment.

### 6.4.3 Version Control for Research and Trading: The GitFlow Workflow

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. **Git** is the world's most popular version control system, and it is an essential tool for quantitative finance, providing the auditability and collaboration capabilities required for professional research.31

However, using Git effectively requires a structured branching strategy. A **workflow** is a prescribed set of rules for how branches are created, named, and merged. One of the most robust and widely adopted strategies is the **GitFlow workflow**.32 It is particularly well-suited for projects that have a clear distinction between ongoing development and stable, production-level releases, which maps directly to the quant research and deployment cycle.33

The GitFlow workflow defines a set of specific branch roles 32:

- **`main` branch:** This branch represents the official, stable, production-ready code. It is always deployable. Commits are never made directly to `main`; it only receives merges from `release` and `hotfix` branches.
    
- **`develop` branch:** This is the primary integration branch where all completed features are merged. It represents the "bleeding edge" of the next release.
    
- **`feature/<name>` branches:** All new development work happens on feature branches. Each new piece of work—a new trading strategy, a data connector, a risk model—is developed in isolation on its own branch, which is created from `develop`. For example, `feature/mean-reversion-strategy`.
    
- **`release/<version>` branches:** When the `develop` branch has accumulated enough features for a new release, a `release` branch is created from `develop`. This branch is used for final testing, bug fixing, and preparation for deployment. No new features are added here.
    
- **`hotfix/<name>` branches:** If a critical bug is discovered in the `main` (production) branch, a `hotfix` branch is created directly from `main`. This allows for a quick patch to be made and merged back into both `main` and `develop` without disrupting the ongoing development cycle.
    

**Mapping GitFlow to a Quant Workflow:**

This branching model aligns perfectly with the lifecycle of quantitative research and trading 9:

1. **Hypothesis:** A new trading idea, such as a pairs trading strategy, is formulated. An issue is created in the project's issue tracker, and a new feature branch is created from `develop`: `git checkout -b feature/pairs-trading-vix`.
    
2. **Development & Research:** The quant develops the strategy code, backtests it, and runs analyses within this isolated `feature` branch. All commits related to this specific strategy are contained here.
    
3. **Integration & Review:** Once the strategy is deemed promising and its unit tests pass, a pull request is created to merge `feature/pairs-trading-vix` into the `develop` branch. This is a point for code review by peers. On the `develop` branch, the new strategy is tested in conjunction with other existing strategies.
    
4. **Staging & Paper Trading:** At the end of a research cycle (e.g., end of a quarter), the `develop` branch is considered ready for a new release. A `release/2024-Q3-alpha` branch is created. This version of the system is deployed to a paper trading environment for final validation with live market data.
    
5. **Deployment:** After successful paper trading, the `release` branch is merged into `main`. This action signifies that the code is now production-grade. The `main` branch is then deployed to the live trading environment. The commit on `main` is tagged with the version number (e.g., `v1.2.0`).
    
6. **Hotfix:** If a critical issue is found in the live trading system (e.g., an issue with the order management logic), a `hotfix/fix-order-slippage-bug` branch is created from `main`, patched, and merged back into `main` and `develop` to ensure the fix is incorporated into all future work.
    

This disciplined workflow ensures a clear separation between experimental research and stable production code, provides a full audit trail for every change, and facilitates seamless collaboration within a quant team.

## 6.5 Chapter Capstone: A Pairs Trading Strategy Engine

This capstone project synthesizes every concept covered in this chapter—high-performance computing, object-oriented design, and professional software engineering practices—to build a complete, end-to-end backtesting engine for a pairs trading strategy.

### 6.5.1 Project Goal

The objective is to build a reusable Python engine to research and backtest a **pairs trading strategy**. Pairs trading is a classic market-neutral, statistical arbitrage strategy. It operates on a pair of financial instruments (e.g., two stocks, two ETFs) whose prices have historically moved together. The core idea is that when the price spread between the two instruments deviates significantly from its historical average, it will eventually revert to the mean. The strategy aims to profit from this mean reversion by simultaneously shorting the overperforming asset and buying the underperforming asset.34

For this project, we will use two highly correlated US ETFs: **SPY** (SPDR S&P 500 ETF) and **QQQ** (Invesco QQQ Trust, tracking the NASDAQ-100).

### 6.5.2 Guiding Questions and Detailed Responses

#### Project Setup: How do we structure this project and its Git repository for success?

**Response:** A robust and reproducible project starts with a standardized structure and disciplined version control.

1. **Project Scaffolding:** We will use `cookiecutter-data-science` to generate the project directory. This immediately provides a clean, logical layout for data, source code, notebooks, and reports, ensuring the project is easy to navigate and maintain.24
    
    - Command: `cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science`
        
2. **Version Control Initialization:** Inside the newly created project directory, we will initialize a Git repository and set up the GitFlow branches.
    
    - `git init`
        
    - `git flow init -d` (The `-d` flag accepts default branch names).
        
    - This creates the `main` and `develop` branches, establishing our production vs. development separation.32
        
3. **Feature Development:** All work for this capstone will occur on a dedicated feature branch.
    
    - `git checkout -b feature/pairs-trading-engine`
        
    - This isolates our development work from the stable `develop` branch until it is complete and tested.32
        

#### Cointegration Analysis: What is the mathematical basis for pairs trading, and how can we efficiently test for it?

**Response:** The mathematical foundation of pairs trading is **cointegration**. Two time series, Xt​ and Yt​, are cointegrated if they are both individually non-stationary (typically integrated of order 1, I(1), meaning they have a unit root), but a linear combination of them is stationary.34 This stationary linear combination is the "spread," and its stationarity implies it is mean-reverting. This is a much stronger statistical relationship than simple correlation, which can be spurious between two trending time series.34

We will use the **Engle-Granger two-step cointegration test** 36:

1. **Step 1: Regress one price series on the other.** We estimate the long-run relationship by running an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression:
    
    Yt​=α+βXt​+ϵt​
    
    The coefficient β is the **hedge ratio**, representing the number of units of asset X to short for every unit of asset Y held long. The residuals, ϵt​=Yt​−α−βXt​, represent the spread at time t.
    
2. **Step 2: Test the residuals for stationarity.** We perform an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test on the residuals ϵt​. The null hypothesis of the ADF test is that the series has a unit root (is non-stationary).
    

The `statsmodels` library provides a convenient function, `coint`, that performs this entire test.36 The key output is the p-value.

- **Interpretation:** If the p-value is less than a significance level (e.g., 0.05), we **reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration**. This provides statistical evidence that the pair is cointegrated and the spread is mean-reverting, making them a suitable candidate for a pairs trading strategy.36
    

The following Python code demonstrates how to perform this test on historical data for SPY and QQQ.

Python

```
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import coint

# Download historical data
spy_data = yf.download('SPY', start='2020-01-01', end='2023-12-31')['Adj Close']
qqq_data = yf.download('QQQ', start='2020-01-01', end='2023-12-31')['Adj Close']

# Perform the cointegration test
coint_test_result = coint(spy_data, qqq_data)
p_value = coint_test_result

print(f"Cointegration Test for SPY and QQQ")
print(f"T-statistic: {coint_test_result:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {p_value:.4f}")
print(f"Critical values: {coint_test_result}")

if p_value < 0.05:
    print("\nThe p-value is less than 0.05. We reject the null hypothesis.")
    print("Conclusion: SPY and QQQ are likely cointegrated.")
else:
    print("\nThe p-value is not less than 0.05. We fail to reject the null hypothesis.")
    print("Conclusion: SPY and QQQ are likely not cointegrated.")
```

#### System Design: How do we design a reusable `Strategy` and `Backtester` using OOP?

**Response:** We will apply the OOP design pattern discussed in section 6.3, creating a modular and reusable system with a `Strategy` class that defines the trading logic and a `Backtester` class that handles the simulation mechanics.

The `PairsTradingStrategy` will be responsible for calculating the spread and generating trading signals. The `VectorizedBacktester` will take any `Strategy` object, run it on historical data, and produce performance metrics. This design allows us to easily test different pairs or even entirely different strategies (e.g., a moving average crossover) with the same backtesting engine.37

Here is the Python code for these classes, which would be placed in the `src/` directory.

**File: `src/strategy.py`**

Python

```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

    @abstractmethod
    def generate_signals(self, data):
        pass

        self.pair_y = pair_y
        self.pair_x = pair_x
        self.lookback = lookback_window
        self.entry_z = entry_z
        self.exit_z = exit_z

    def generate_signals(self, data):
        y = data[self.pair_y]
        x = data[self.pair_x]
        
        # Calculate rolling hedge ratio (beta) and spread
        x_const = sm.add_constant(x)
        rolling_beta = x_const.rolling(window=self.lookback).apply(
            lambda w: sm.OLS(y.loc[w.index], w).fit().params[self.pair_x], raw=False
        )

        spread_mean = spread.rolling(window=self.lookback).mean()
        spread_std = spread.rolling(window=self.lookback).std()
        z_score = (spread - spread_mean) / spread_std
        
        # Generate signals
        signals = pd.DataFrame(index=data.index)
        signals['z_score'] = z_score
        signals[self.pair_y] = 0
        signals[self.pair_x] = 0
        
        # Entry signals
        signals.loc[signals['z_score'] > self.entry_z, self.pair_y] = -1 # Short Y
        signals.loc[signals['z_score'] < -self.entry_z, self.pair_y] = 1  # Long Y
        
        # The position in X is the opposite, scaled by the hedge ratio
        signals[self.pair_x] = -signals[self.pair_y] * rolling_beta
        
        # Exit signals (not implemented for simplicity, positions are held until z-score crosses zero)
        # A more advanced version would use exit_z to close positions
        
        return signals.ffill().fillna(0)
```

**File: `src/backtester.py`**

Python

```
import pandas as pd

        }
        return self.results

    def plot_results(self):
        if self.results is None:
            print("Run the backtest first.")
            return

        plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
        self.results['equity_curve'].plot(label='Strategy Equity', legend=True)

    def calculate_performance_metrics(self):
        if self.results is None:

        total_return = equity_curve.iloc[-1] - 1
        days = (equity_curve.index[-1] - equity_curve.index).days
        cagr = (equity_curve.iloc[-1])**(365.0/days) - 1
        
        # Max Drawdown
        rolling_max = equity_curve.cummax()
        daily_drawdown = equity_curve / rolling_max - 1.0
        max_drawdown = daily_drawdown.cummin().iloc[-1]
        
        metrics = {
            'CAGR': f"{cagr:.2%}",
            'Annualized Sharpe Ratio': f"{sharpe_ratio:.2f}",
            'Max Drawdown': f"{max_drawdown:.2%}",

```

#### Ensuring Correctness: How do we verify that the core logic is correct?

**Response:** We will create a `tests/` directory and use `pytest` to write unit tests for our core components. This ensures that our spread calculation, signal generation, and performance metrics are mathematically correct before we trust the backtest results.

**File: `tests/test_pairs_trading.py`**

Python

```
import pytest
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from src.strategy import PairsTradingStrategy

@pytest.fixture
def sample_pair_data():
    """A pytest fixture to provide sample data for testing."""
    dates = pd.to_datetime(pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=100))
    # Create two correlated series with a known spread
    x_data = np.linspace(100, 110, 100)
    spread = np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10, 100)) * 2 # A predictable sine wave spread
    y_data = 1.5 * x_data + spread # y = 1.5*x + spread
    
    data = pd.DataFrame({'Y': y_data, 'X': x_data}, index=dates)
    return data

def test_signal_generation(sample_pair_data):
    """
    Test if signals are generated correctly at spread extremes.
    """
    # Arrange
    strategy = PairsTradingStrategy('Y', 'X', lookback_window=20, entry_z=1.5)
    
    # Act
    signals = strategy.generate_signals(sample_pair_data)
    
    # Assert
    # Find the point of maximum positive z-score (where spread is highest)
    max_z_idx = signals['z_score'].idxmax()
    # At this point, we should be short Y (-1)
    assert signals.loc == -1
    
    # Find the point of minimum negative z-score (where spread is lowest)
    min_z_idx = signals['z_score'].idxmin()
    # At this point, we should be long Y (1)
    assert signals.loc == 1
```

This test uses a fixture to create synthetic data where the relationship between the pair is known. It then asserts that the strategy correctly identifies the points of maximum and minimum deviation to generate short and long signals, respectively. Similar tests would be written for the `VectorizedBacktester` to verify its P&L calculations against a known sequence of trades.

### 6.5.3 Final Deliverable: The Complete Backtest

Finally, we create a main script in the project root (e.g., `run_backtest.py`) that brings all the components together. This script will:

1. Import the necessary classes from the `src` directory.
    
2. Download real market data using `yfinance`.
    
3. Instantiate the `PairsTradingStrategy` and `VectorizedBacktester`.
    
4. Run the backtest.
    
5. Print the performance metrics and display the equity curve plot.
    

**File: `run_backtest.py`**

Python

```
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf
from src.strategy import PairsTradingStrategy
from src.backtester import VectorizedBacktester

def main():
    # --- 1. Configuration ---
    pair_y_ticker = 'SPY'
    pair_x_ticker = 'QQQ'
    start_date = '2015-01-01'
    end_date = '2023-12-31'
    
    # --- 2. Data Loading ---
    print(f"Downloading data for {pair_y_ticker} and {pair_x_ticker}...")
    y_data = yf.download(pair_y_ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)['Adj Close']
    x_data = yf.download(pair_x_ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)['Adj Close']
    
    data = pd.DataFrame({pair_y_ticker: y_data, pair_x_ticker: x_data})
    data.dropna(inplace=True)
    
    # --- 3. Strategy & Backtester Initialization ---
    print("Initializing strategy and backtester...")
    pairs_strategy = PairsTradingStrategy(
        pair_y=pair_y_ticker, 
        pair_x=pair_x_ticker,
        lookback_window=60,
        entry_z=2.0
    )
    
    backtester = VectorizedBacktester(strategy=pairs_strategy, data=data)
    
    # --- 4. Run Backtest and Evaluate ---
    print("Running backtest...")
    backtester.run()
    
    print("\n" + "="*30)
    print("      BACKTEST RESULTS")
    print("="*30 + "\n")
    backtester.calculate_performance_metrics()
    
    print("\nPlotting equity curve...")
    backtester.plot_results()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Running this script (`python run_backtest.py`) executes the entire workflow, from data acquisition to performance evaluation, demonstrating a complete, professional, and reproducible quantitative research process built on the advanced Python principles detailed throughout this chapter.
